Quiz Application
================

This is a simple quiz application I made for a client.  The rest of the documentation is intended for the client.

Building It
----------------
You'll need the [android adt plugin](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html) for eclipse installed to build the app with updated configuration or questions.  The app minimum API level is 8.

Changing the Configuration
---------------------------
Configuration is stored in the file [res/values/config.xml](https://github.com/jjmason/android-quiz/blob/master/res/values/config.xml) which contains documentation for the individual settings.  Note that all of the settings are *required*.  The configuration is updated on the device whenever the app files are newer than the time it was created, so basically every time you change something and run the app.

Editing Questions
---------------------------
The questions currently live in [assets/quiz-example.xml](https://github.com/jjmason/android-quiz/blob/master/assets/quiz-example.xml).  That file contains documentation for the format.  The question database is automatically repopulated whenever the app files are newer than the data currently in the database.  For normal users it should only populate the database once.
